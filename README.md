# EMOD QuickStart
Flat files for running EMOD without installer

The setenv.cmd script in this set of files will temporarily modify the PATH and
PYTHONPATH (and PYTHON_PATH which is sometimes used by the EMOD software) to
allow the EMOD software and associated scripts to run without requiring an
installation of the Visual C++ runtimes, MPI implementation, and Python.
